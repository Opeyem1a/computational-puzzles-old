1.
Cross the bridge to see the kokanee spawn
Head towards the stairs for the turtle pond
Stop and look around for a QR code 
Hidden beneath where the wind might blow

2. 
Continue along the trail down low
Walk pass the bench and see where you might go
Soon there'll be rocks by a fallen tree
And that's where this puzzle is gonna be

3. 
Take the stairs up to see trees of pine
Walk back where you started to find a sign
It's the way to say pine in Nsyilxc…ôn
Look across and carefully scan the region.
